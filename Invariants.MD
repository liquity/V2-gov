Snapshot Solvency

            uint256 claim = _votesForInitiativeSnapshot.votes * boldAccrued / _votesSnapshot.votes;
For each initiative this is what the value is
If the initiative is "Claimable" this is what it receives
The call never reverts
The sum of claims is less than the boldAccrued

Veto consistency
